//! State-root task interface types shared between the engine tree and the payload builder.
//!
//! The "state-root task" is the background multiproof and sparse-trie pipeline that computes
//! state roots incrementally while a block executes. This module holds its boundary types:
//! the input messages, the [`StateRootSink`](crate::state_root_task::StateRootSink) and
//! stream views that feed it, and the handles
//! that await its result. The per-block strategy abstraction that decides whether and how the
//! task runs lives in `reth-engine-tree` under `tree::state_root_strategy`.
